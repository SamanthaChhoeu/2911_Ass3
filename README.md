Todo list:
Front End
1. fix problem in gameview so that you don't have to destroy and recreate the gamePanel to refresh the game
2. Fix problem in gameview where the utilityPanel shows on the right hand side
    2.1. add a timer onto this panel which shows how long a user is taking on a puzzle
        2.2. add a pause button which pauses the game and allows the user to resume, restart or quit
3. Change the views to make the game more prettier than a basic view
4. find some unique features which you can implement which affect front end (e.g. smoother animations or different view)

Back End
1. Do the board generation
2. build a function so that the game resets itself when you press r (or JButton press)
3. build a function so that the user can undo their last move (no of moves that's saved is up to you)
4. find some unique features which you can implement which affect back end (e.g. ai to chase player, unique game mode)
